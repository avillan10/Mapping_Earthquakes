Module 13: Mapping Earthquakes with JS &amp; APIs

## Background
For this module challenge we are to create a visual map that displays the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, as well as the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables: Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data, Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data, Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map.
